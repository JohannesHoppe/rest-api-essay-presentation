# Relevance of Web APIs

**API First!**
<br>
<small>
It's no longer Web first or mobile first.
</small>

<br><br>
**We live in an _API Economy_.** [1][1]

<br><br>
**The _Chief API Officer_ term is coined.** [2][2]

<br><br>
**If it's not programmable, it doesn't exist.**
<br>

# History of distributed System Integration Paradigms

---

# Non-scientific enumeration of past Hypes

- Integrated via asynchronous messaging (MQ).
  - Popular when mainframes were hip.

- Remote Procedure Calls (RPC).
  - Often with CORBA as a protocol.

- Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
  - Still popular in enterprise IT but irrelevant for mobile computing.
  - Although not mandated, the integration protocol of choice in SOAs is/ was SOAP/HTTP and SOAP via asynchronous protocols.

- Pseudo-REST APIs ‒ <span class="red">today<span>.
  - "pseudo" because they do not fulfill all of the commonly accepted criteria of a REST API.

---

# Prospected Future

- REST APIs ‒ **approaching**.

- Semantic REST APIs ‒ **future**.

Both are further elaborated below.

---

# SOA vs. REST (1/2)

Google trends for the terms _SOAP API_ and _REST API_:

<iframe src="//www.google.com/trends/fetchComponent?hl=en-US&amp;q=soap+api,+rest+api&amp;cmpt=q&amp;content=1&amp;cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&amp;export=5&amp;w=650&amp;h=330" style="border: none;" height="330" width="650"></iframe>

<small>Generally a weak comparision, yes, but is significant for our purpose.</small>

---

# SOA vs. REST (2/2)

In one of the largest independent and publicly available directories for APIs, the Programmableweb,
the share of Internet APIs by technology in March 2014 is:

![API protocols](http://www.bogotobogo.com/WebTechnologies/images/OpenAPI_RESTful/API_Protocols.png)

REST (69%), SOAP (18%), JavaScript (5%), and XML-RPC (2%).

<!--
# REST is still on the Rise
http://de.slideshare.net/programmableweb/web-api-growthsince2005
-->

---

# Qualitative Advantages of REST over SOAP

- Developers like REST because the learning curve is less steep.
  - Web Services' contract first appraoch (early binding) is more complex.
  - It requires a longer/ deeper toolchain to be equally productive.

- Better client support in most languages.
  - SOAP clients for PHP and NodeJS are still not on par with Java.

- The whole footprint of SOAP is too big for mobile.
  - Parsing of JSON is less compute and memory intensive than XML.
  - Required technology stack is more complex.

---

# Conclusions

1. We saw an exponential growth of the number of offered WEB APIs.

2. In the future of distributed systems computing, most likely only REST and SOA will be relevant
for distributed system integration.

3. SOAP will persist for specialized enterprise
interfaces as part of SOAs and in B2B scenarios.

# What actually is REST?

---

# The Beginning

- **2000:** The doctoral dissertation from Roy Fielding is commonly reckoned as the manifesto of the REST API vision.

<iframe src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm"></iframe>

---

# A Definition

###  <span class="red">Re</span>presentational <span class="red">S</span>tate <span class="red">T</span>ransfer.

> REST is an architectural style consisting of a coordinated set of architectural constraints applied to components,
connectors, and data elements, within a distributed hypermedia system.
<br><small>‒ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer</small>


<br>
“Representation”: A way of formatting/ serializing a resource, such as JSON, HTML, PNG.

---

# What REST isn't / what you can't do with it

- It's not a product → you cannot buy it.

- It is not a (Web) standard.

- It's not a protocol or about a single protocol (HTTP).

- There is no reference implementation.

---

# The Past Drivers

- **2006:** API pioneers eBay, Amazon and Google Maps were among the first to offer popular Web APIs.

- **2007:** The mobile revolution kicked off by smart phones.

- **2013:** Mobile and infotainment platforms diversity (Jolla, BB10, Tizen, Ubuntu, WP, FF OS, Android...).

# Future Drivers

- **2015+:** Babylonic language diversity (Only some newer ones: Rust, Go, Dart).

<!--
developers like SDKs but is it realistic for an API provider to offer an SDK for `n` languages?
-->
- **2016+:** Internet of things (vehicles, household appliances, ...every power plug).
  - 15B connected devices in 2015, 40B connected devices in 2020.

---

# REST Constraints (1/2)

The essence of Fieldings thesis is the following series of constraints:

- Client-server.

  <small>
  _separation of concerns_ — A clean separation of duty exists between client and server;
  server is responsible for data processing and persistence, client to drive the interaction.
  </small>

- Stateless.

  <small>
  Server must only use the data in a request to service it; no further context info.
  </small>

- Cacheable.

  <small>
  The data within a response to a request must be implicitly or explicitly labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable.
  </small>

- Layered system.

  <small>
  Servers do not know whether there are layers of abstraction between themselves and the end client.
  </small>

-->

---

# REST Constraints (2/2)

- Code on demand (optional).

  <small>
  Servers can temporarily extend or customize the functionality of a client by the transfer of executable code.
  </small>

- Uniform interface:

  - Identification of resources (not a representation).

  <small>
  Individual resources are identifiable with a GUID.
  </small>

  - Manipulation via representations.

  <small>
  Possible interactions can be introspected.
  </small>

  - Self descriptive messages.

  <small>
  A resource can be understood syntactically and semantically from the carried data and meta-data.
  </small>

  - Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS).

  <small>
  Clients make state transitions only through actions that are dynamically identified within hypermedia by the server.
  </small>

---

# The Hypermedia Constraint (1/2)

- is often-overlooked; ~99% of existing APIs don't do this right,

- is not particularly easy to achieve as it requires quite some effort (and a smart client),

- is the main enabler for the _loose coupling_ principle.

---

# The Hypermedia Constraint (2/2)

Consider that an API client can be modelled as a state machine.

The hypermedia constraint says that the client must be able to use the API
without knowing this state machine at design time.

Consequence: Resources must describe their
- Relations,

- Affordances (possible operations).

---

# Client State Machine Example

# But what is all this good for?

Put in some quotes:

<br>

> A REST API is just a Web site for users with a limited vocabulary.
<br><small>‒ Roy Fielding in 2013</small>

<br>
<br>

> You are the most advanced API client while using your browser.
We need to enable machines acting on your behalf to accomplish
the same tasks through future APIs.
<br><small>‒ Thomas Hoppe, 2015</small>

<br>
<br>

---

# What we gain from real REST

Put in hard facts:

- URLs can change without breaking clients,
- Resource representations can change in terms of:
  - Granularity,
  - Affordances,
  - Relations.

__→ Client and Server can evolve independently.__

- Discoverability,
- Performance through cacheability.

---

# The ultimate Test

Provide an API client with just the __entry point__ of your API.
If this is sufficient for the client to use the API in its entirety,
the API adheres to at least a good subset of the REST constraints.

And the client is a proper REST client.

---

# What do pseudo REST APIs do wrong?

In the case of HTTP based REST:

- Interact only with a single endpoint instead of resources.
- Use HTTP as tunneling protocol.
  - RPCish interaction (command messages) interaction.
- No hypermedia, no HATEOAS.
  - Assumptions about available representations and transitions are hard-coded (or configured).
- Stateful communication.
- Resources/ messages/ data is not self-descriptive.
- Appropriate HTTP methods are not used; e. g. only GET.
- Content negotiation is not used.
- Proper HTTP response codes are not provided/ interpreted.

# Versioning

> Versioning an interface is just a polite way to kill deployed applications
<br><small>‒ Roy Fielding in 2013</small>

When did you last see a version on a Web site?

---

# Notable Qualities about HTTP Methods

Read only:
- GET,
- HEAD,
- OPTIONS.

Idempotent:
- PUT,
- DELETE.

Potentially idempotent:
- POST.

---

# So aren't there existing approaches?

Sure, here are a few media types which are at least hypermedia-aware:

- HAL <small>http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html</small>.
- SIREN <small>https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren</small>.
- SVG, Atom, (X)HTML(!).
- JSON Hyper-Schema <small>http://json-schema.org/</small>.
- JSON API <small>http://jsonapi.org/</small>.
- UBER Hypermedia <small>http://uberhypermedia.org/</small>.

<small>Note: JSON itself is not hypermedia-aware.</small>

My conclusion about them is, however, that most of them only address
the hypermedia issue but all of them lack at least one of the following features:

- Describing complex affordances like contextual actions/ operations.
- Provide a possbility to represent data really in a self-descripive manner.

→ Let's see whether we can do better.

# The Semantic Web

---

# Ehrrm, isn't this long time dead?!

In the form which has been procalimed for decades ‒ probably yes.

![Semantic Web Logo](http://bloghelpline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Logo_Semantic_Web.png)

---

# The Semantic Web technology Stack

![Semantic Web Logo](http://bnode.org/media/2009/07/08/semantic_web_technology_stack.png)

---

# So what were the Issues?

- Complexity (full stack including ontologies).

- No comprehensible value add.

- Triplestores:
  - immature,
  - slow,
  - only few implementations (very few commercial).

- SPARQL:
  - complex,
  - few implementations,
  - inappropriate for many real-world problems.

- No killer application.
  - For a long time it was a rather academic topic.

# RDF

<span class="red">R</span>esource <span class="red">D</span>escription <span class="red">F</span>ramework.

- Technically a data model for labeled, directed multi-graphs.

- There is a variety of serialization formats
(e. g. RDF/XML, N3, Turtle, N-Triples, JSON-LD).

- RDF based data consists of statements about “things” (Web resources)
in the form of subject-predicate-object expressions, also known as triples.
  - Statements can describe facts with literals,

  - and interrelations to other things.

# Some Definitions

“Resource”: A uniquely identifiable thing, typically identified by an IRI.

“Subject”: The resource a statement is about.

“Predicate”: A term used to describe or modify some aspect of the subject.
Usually it denotes relationships between the subject and the object.

“Object”: In English the object of a sentence is the thing that the verb is
acting upon. In RDF, it’s the “target” or “value” of the triple.

“Literal”: Are always typed, defaulting to string.
The types are again just RDF resources. It is, however, recommeded to use
XSD types such as `http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int` whenever possible.

<!--
information resource - A resource for which all essential characteristics can be transmitted in a message (i.e. a digital resource). Historically, information resources have been the primary focus of the Web. When most users enter a URL into a web browser, they assume that the result will be the return of an information resource in the form of a digital file. Examples: html web page, digital image, pfd file.
non-information resource - A resource that cannot be transmitted electronically. Non-information resources can be further subdivided into the following categories:

    - physical resource - a material thing. Examples: an animal, a specimen, a 35 mm slide
    - abstract resource - a non-material, non-electronic thing. Examples: a taxonomic concept, a relationship, a determination
-->
---

# Possible Values of Triple Elements

__Subject__: Only resources.

__Predicate__: Only resources.

__Object__: Resources or literals.

# Text Localization in RDF

- RDF has the concept of text localization baked in!

- Since RDF 1.1 `rdf:langString` is the date type for localized literals.

- [BCP47](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) language tags like `de-AT` are used
  to denote the language.

<br>
RDF/XML:
````
<foaf:firstName xml:lang="DE">Thomas</foaf:firstName>

Turtle/ N3:

# Vocabularies

__Goal__: Establish common, shared terms for a domain.

__Comprising__:

- Individuals (instances, objects),
- Classes (concepts, types),
- Properties (relations, roles),
- Rules (axioms).

There are multiple vocabularies, to define vocabularies such as RDFS and OWL.

If they are rather complex (meany), they are also called _ontologies_.

Technically they are nothing else than a bunch of RDF resources which
are mostly used as predicates in other RDF resources.

# Where to get a Vocab for my Domain?!

1. Check what other people already have modelled:
  - [schema.org](http://schema.org) — from Google and other search engines,
  - [http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/](http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/) —
    Linked Open Vocabularies,
  - [http://vocab.cc/](http://vocab.cc/) — RDF vocabulary search and lookup.

2. Create your own one
  - Just coin an IRI without having an actual vocab,
  - RDFS (RDF Schema),
  - OWL.

---

# What we gain from using RDF

- Often times you don't need to model your domain as their terms and relations
are already defined by existing vocabularies.

- RDF based data is highly interoperable.
  - Independent of syntax.
  - Independent of platform (operating system, application, programming language).
  - Unambiguous meaning of every relation (property in JSON-LD).
  - Minimal risk of naming collisions.

- Data models are extensible as it is based on an
[Open World Assumption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption).

- Allows the the construction of the digital equivalent of natural language
sentences and thus machine interpretation.

# Linked Data

# Linked Data

- It's about things and their relations, not about documents.

- For me something like the second take on the Semantic Web.

- Still based on RDF and co.

- Ultimate objective: Make the Web a single database.

# Linked Data Principes

1. Use **URIs to denote things**.

2. Use **HTTP URIs** so that these things can be referred to and **looked up** ("dereferenced") by people and user agents.

3. **Provide useful information about the thing when its URI is dereferenced**, leveraging standards such as RDF, SPARQL.

4. Include **links to other related things** (using their URIs) when publishing data on the Web.

<small>Tim Berners-Lee, 2006<small>

---

# URLs, URIs, IRIs WTF?

- In the past, the Semantic Web was all about URIs.

- In 2005 they gained Unicode support with IRIs.

- URLs are just URIs/ IRIs which can be dereferenced.

---

# Linked Data Components

- URIs/ IRIs (specifically, of the dereferenceable variety).

- HTTP.

- Resource Description Framework (RDF).

- Serialization formats (RDFa, RDF/XML, N3, Turtle, JSON-LD, and others).

time doing something more useful, like actually making machines smarter

# JSON-LD by Example (1/2)

Plain JSON:

````
{
  "id": "http://thomashoppe.me",
  "firstName": "Thomas",
  "lastName": "Hoppe",
  "workplaceHomepage": "http://www.n-fuse.de"
}
````

JSON-LD:

````
{
  "@id": "http://thomashoppe.me",
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/firstName": "Thomas",
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/lastName": "Hoppe",
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/workplaceHomepage": "http://www.n-fuse.de"
}
````

---

# JSON-LD by Example (2/2)

Using an `@context` to shorten things and typing it using `@type`:

````
{
  "@context": {
    "id": "@id",
    "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/",
    "firstName": "foaf:firstName",
    "lastName": "foaf:lastName",
    "workplaceHomepage": "foaf:workplaceHomepage"
  },
  "@type": "foaf:Person",
  "id": "http://thomashoppe.me",
  "firstName": "Thomas",
  "lastName": "Hoppe",
  "workplaceHomepage": "http://www.n-fuse.de"
}
````

The `@context` can also be announced with an appropriate header:

<small>
`Link: <http://thomashoppe.me/person.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"`
</small>

# Polymorphy of JSON-LD and Compaction

JSON documents __1__ & __2__ are semantically equivalent:

__1:__

````
{
  "@id": "http://thomashoppe.me",
  "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/firstName": "Thomas"
}
````

__2:__

````
{
  "@context": {
    "id": "@id",
    "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/",
    "firstName": "foaf:firstName"
  },
  "id": "http://thomashoppe.me",
  "firstName": "Thomas"
}
````

I can transform 1 into 2 with the `@context` of 2 and the JSON-LD
__compaction__. See
[playground example](http://json-ld.org/playground/index.html#startTab=tab-compacted&json-ld=%7B%22%40id%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fthomashoppe.me%22%2C%22http%3A%2F%2Fxmlns.com%2Ffoaf%2F0.1%2FfirstName%22%3A%22Thomas%22%7D&context=%7B%22id%22%3A%22%40id%22%2C%22foaf%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fxmlns.com%2Ffoaf%2F0.1%2F%22%2C%22firstName%22%3A%22foaf%3AfirstName%22%7D).

# Declaring Links in JSON-LD

````
{
  "@context": {
    ...
    "workplaceHomepage": {
      "@type": "@id",
      "@id": "foaf:workplaceHomepage"
    }
  },
  ...
  "workplaceHomepage": "http://www.n-fuse.de"
}
````

<br>
Effectively, this declares that the value of the `workplaceHomepage` property
is a resource.


<!--
The effect in N-Quads:

````
_:b0 <foaf:workplaceHomepage> <http://www.n-fuse.de> .

vs. without @id

_:b0 <foaf:workplaceHomepage> "http://www.n-fuse.de" .
````
